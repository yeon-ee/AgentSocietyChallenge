    "review": "Dan's Fresh Meats is an absolute gem! The Italian hoagie I had was hands down the best I've ever tasted—freshly sliced meats, perfectly balanced toppings, and a roll that was just right. Dan's personal touch and friendly service made the experience even better. I'll definitely be back for more!"
