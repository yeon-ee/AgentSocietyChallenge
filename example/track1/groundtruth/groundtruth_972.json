    "review": "I decided to give Crab Du Jour a try after hearing mixed reviews, and my experience was just okay. The seafood was fresh, but the seasoning felt a bit off—too salty for my taste. The service was quick, which was a plus, but the overall flavor didn't quite live up to the hype. It's a decent spot if you're in the area, but I might try something else next time."
