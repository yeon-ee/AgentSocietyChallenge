    "review": "I had a great experience at Little Istanbul! The food was flavorful and authentic, especially the lamb gyro, which was juicy and well-seasoned. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy. While the portions were a bit small, the quality made up for it. I’ll definitely be back to try more dishes!"
