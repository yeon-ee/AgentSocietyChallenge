    "review": "I had a decent experience at Pastore Auto Tags & Insurance. The staff was friendly and efficient, and they handled my registration and title transfer quickly. While there were a few hiccups with paperwork, they were resolved promptly. Overall, it was a smooth process and I’d recommend them for their professionalism."
